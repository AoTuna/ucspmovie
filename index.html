<h1>The Weeping Sacrifices</h1>

There must be a cold sacrifice:
	You must venture alone,
	and endure the head of responsibility
	through the shivering cold vessels of the seaside.
	Nothing else other than family will make you tear.

There must be an explosive sacrifice:
	You must save ones below,
	til the depths of mining rocks has found its coal.
	I mean without leaving the companions that struggle, 
	for example, because living for others is
	extremely respectable.
	The woman that he saw was the only comfort he found.

	Those gas pipes that initiated for combustion,
	that brick building that erupted for destruction.
 	The soldiers on the grass that planned for detonation,
	they shot the limb that looked similarly cold.
	What has the world done to deserve this?

	I mean without serious consideration, a dog,
	for example, has a better purpose in living.
	
There must be a firm sacrifice:
	An old, run-down store that has survived countless
	attempts to be sold.
	The businessmen and the people that shame the old man's
	poker face.
	He only wanted to protect something he deared so much.
	that worried his family and his love.

There must be a great resolute:
	The screens that displayed the face of a girl,
	and those confuzzled puddles of tears,
	it must have been relief, must have been at ease
	to know of someone you know, whom you struggled
	to find for so long.
 	At the end of the day,
	to let go of something precious, like the store,
	for example, when the father who promised to reunite
	is probably too old to come home.
